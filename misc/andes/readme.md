This is a vulnerable Ethereum smart contract that is susceptible due to it's reliance of the `extcodesize` function to determine whether the transaction sender is a wallet or a smart contract, via ensuring the sender contract size is equal to 0. In Ethereum, a contract that is being created will invoke a constructor to initialize some values of the smart contract. During the execution of the constructor, the contract size of the to-be deployed contract is 0, until the constructor execution is complete. This means that extcodesize will think we are calling the functions as a wallet, not as a contract, giving us the ability to rig the smart contract so that we win. See solve.sol
