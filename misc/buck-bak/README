Multiple layer osint/pwn chall

Dockerfile on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/judyhoppsbuckeye1986/buck-bak). Nothing interesting in buck-bak:latest but older revisions have BitBucket repo link and a build server netcat command.

The build server asks for the user to supply a branch name to build (and run). Initially, the only branch you can guess is main. With the BitBucket repo you can see that there is a another branch. This branch has code with a stack overflow vulnerability.

pwn the built code on the new branch to read flag.
