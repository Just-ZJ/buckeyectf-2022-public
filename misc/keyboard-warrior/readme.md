The pcap is a pcap of a normal wireless keyboard. To make the challenge, I literally just opened Wireshark, connected the keyboard, then typed in a bunch of random words and the flag, and then disconnected from the keyboard. Beating the challenge requires knowing the importance of the BT_ATT packets and noticing how the value of BTATT layers change throughout the PCAP. We can quickly get the hex values of all key entries via applying a filter to BT_ATT packets where the value field is non-zero. From there, we can find a mapping of hex values to ascii values online and use that over the set of collected hex values. See `solve.py`.
