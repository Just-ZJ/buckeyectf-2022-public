I generated a massive Minecraft world over the course of a couple hours, then teleported to a random location and placed a sign with the flag.
The intended solution was *not* to search the world manually or even use something like WorldEdit.
Iterating over the tile entities in each chunk would find you all the signs, and the NBT can be inspected from there.

By the way, the Minecraft world is too big to upload here, but you can generate one yourself pretty easily.
