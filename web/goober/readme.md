Goober exploits XXE to achieve SSRF on an internal server. There is a regex check on the user input to block any custom DTDs, but the check only is valid for UTF-8 doctypes, and does not catch alllll possible doc types. One way this challenge can be beat is via encoding the payload into UTF-7. By doing so, we circumvent the Regex that blocks potential malicious input. Then, the SVG must be valid XML, which is determined via interacting with `libxml2`. `libxml2` is ran with the parser.option(2) setting, which enables DTD loading, allowing us to render custom document types. From there, we can easily read in from the internal flag server to achieve SSRF (see `solve.svg`)

There is apparently another solution via exploiting ImageMagick due to a missing setting in `policy.xml`.
