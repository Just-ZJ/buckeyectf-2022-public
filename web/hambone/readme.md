Hambone stores a flag at a random 48 byte path. One function is given, the get_distances() function, which determines the distance for each 16-byte subgroup of the flag and the url. We can check the maximum URL size and determine the maximum path is 96 characters. Thus, it is fair to infer that we should access the flag via a hex address that corresponds to the 48 bytes. 

From there, we can test values such as '0' * 96. This will result in the background of the page equalling the distance that the current path is from the flag, computed via #ffffff - distance. Since the hamming distance will decrease by 1 whenever we correctly guess a bit, we can guess every single bit of the the 48 bytes by modifying a single bit at a time and observing how the background of the page changes. As a byte is two characters in hexadecimal, for each character, we should try checking the bit values of 1,2,4, and 8 and seeing how the background changes. If the background increases in brightness, we are getting closer to the flag. We repeat this for every character, and thus perform 48 bytes * 2 characters per byte * 4 (one for each bit we need to check) searches. From there, we can determine what bits need to be set in order to improve the hamming distance. When all of these bits are combined, we will have the flag hash.
