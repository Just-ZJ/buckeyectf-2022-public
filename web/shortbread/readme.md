Shortbread is a link extender that is vulnerable to request smuggling via an exploit present in GUnicorn 20.0.4 and earlier. Read https://grenfeldt.dev/2021/04/01/gunicorn-20.0.4-request-smuggling/ for more info about the vulnerability. 

Using this `Sec-Websocket-Key1:x` header will cause Gunicorn to incorrectly process a single smuggled request as separate requests, while the reverse proxy only sees one request. This means that any access control applied on the proxy-side will be circumvented if the original request is to an accesible endpoint. Once we get access to the admin endpoints via this exploit, it is fairly trivial to use directory traversal to read the flag from the server. The server takes logs of whenever a user creates an extended link, or an admin modifies / deletes an extended link. Any route that writes to the logs does not allow the user to escape out of the `/app/admin/logs` folder. However, the `/admin/api/logs` route, which reads from the logs, is vulnerable to a path traversal, since the log to read in is passed via an unsanitized URL parameter. This gives us the ability to achieve a directory traversal and read from ../../../../flag.txt.
